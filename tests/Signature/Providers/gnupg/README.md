This is a GnuPG homedir for the `SecurityTxtSignatureGnuPgProviderTest` test.
Files that are not needed for the test were removed.
And yes, I know this directory contains private keys (and that there's a passphrase in the test),
but those keys were generated just for the test and are not used anywhere else.
